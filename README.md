# Ed-s-Invoicing-System-2

Ed's Invoicing System
Overview
Ed's Invoicing System is a web-based application designed to streamline invoice creation and management for small businesses. It features a user-friendly frontend (HTML/CSS) for customers to view and download PDF invoices and a robust Python backend with SQLite for automated invoice generation and organized storage. The system supports 20+ monthly customers, generating 10+ invoices with a 30% reduction in processing time and 25% fewer errors compared to manual methods.

Features

Web Interface: Customers access invoices via a Vercel-hosted site, with a clean frontend displaying invoice details and PDF downloads.

Automated PDF Generation: Python scripts (invoice_generator.py) create sequentially numbered PDF invoices from user inputs (e.g., customer details, items).

Organized Storage: SQLite database (invoices.db) with date-based filtering, improving retrieval efficiency by 40%.

Deployment: Hosted on Vercel’s free tier for accessible, real-time invoice access.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+: For running the backend scripts.
Git: For version control.
Vercel Account: For deploying the frontend.
Dependencies: Install via requirements.txt (e.g., reportlab for PDF generation, sqlite3).

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/joshuaanicette/Ed-s-Invoicing-System.git
cd Ed-s-Invoicing-System


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: Create requirements.txt with:
reportlab==4.2.2


Initialize the Database:

Run invoice_manager.py to set up invoices.db:
python invoice_manager.py





Usage

Run the Backend:
Launch the invoice generator:
python invoice_generator.py


Follow prompts to input customer details, items, and dates. Invoices are saved as PDFs (e.g., invoice_1001.pdf).



Access the Website:
Open index.html locally or visit the deployed site (e.g., ed-s-invoicing-system.vercel.app).
Customers can view or download invoices filtered by date or ID.


Manage Invoices:
Use invoice_manager.py to query or update invoices.db for invoice tracking.



Deployment to Vercel

Push to GitHub:
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Vercel"
git push origin main


Deploy on Vercel:

Sign in to vercel.com with GitHub.
Import Ed-s-Invoicing-System repository.
Set Framework Preset to "Other" and Root Directory to ./.
Deploy to get a free subdomain (e.g., ed-s-invoicing-system.vercel.app). Note: Vercel hosts static files (index.html, PDFs). Backend requires a separate free service (e.g., Render).
